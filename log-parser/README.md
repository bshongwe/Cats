## Concepts Needed:

    File I/O in Python:
        Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
        Python Input and Output

    Signal Handling in Python:
        Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
        Python Signal Handling

    Data Processing:
        Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
        Aggregating data to compute summaries.

    Regular Expressions:
        Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
        Python Regular Expressions

    Dictionaries in Python:
        Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
        Python Dictionaries

    Exception Handling:
        Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
        Python Exceptions

## Learning Objectives
-   Understand file I/O, regular expressions, dictionaries, and exception handling in Python.
-   Implement a script that reads log data from standard input (stdin) and computes metrics.
-   Parse log entries and extract relevant information like IP address, status code, and file size.
-   Handle keyboard interruptions (CTRL+C) gracefully.
